## Under The Hood

Clone this repo and open index.html in the browser, it's just static files accessing GitHub GraphQL API directly.

Node.js is not banned, a build environment is just not needed for this project yet. This is a call out to the strength of web technologies. (Or I'm just old and want my [blink tag](https://www.google.com/search?q=blink+tag) back)
